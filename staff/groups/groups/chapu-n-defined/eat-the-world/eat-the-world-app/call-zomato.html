I maintain the Salsiccia as my favorite though, it is lighter and less salty.",

I wouldn't expect any less from a \"Danny Meyers\" restaurant. I ordered the Prosciutto for my appetizers and the duck for my mains. I was told to order the pizza, but somehow got fixated on the duck. The Prosciutto was good, but the Duck was a whole different story. The minute the first piece went into my mouth, I felt I had attained Nirvana. Oh. My. God. It was cooked to perfection and had this tantalisingly crispy skin which was coated in salt. Ufff. Boy, if I had once dish that I could eat for a long time, it would be that duck.  This was one for the books and I will surely remember this meal for a long time. Can't wait to be back.",

When we first entered from the markets thought it was another shop and the pasta looked amazing but the back open to a restaurant, it was way to early to eat so decided to go back another day. On our return we were give a table very quickly and due to the selection on offer had to get help choosing from the waiter. The food was excellent and portions were massive I struggled to finish my meal. Would recommend this to any one in the area as best pasta I have even eaten.",

The aroma is exquisite and there is tons of pans hanging from the ceilings. Being half restaurant and half market, you can purchase freshly made pasta to-go as well.  Upon being seated, we were given bread served in a small brown paper bag. I ordered the eggplant ravioli. It was succulent and the filling (eggplant paste?) was generous on each piece. The cheese was fantastic and the tomatoes were the perfect combination for it. Our other dish was the orecchiette pasta. It was flavorful, but a bit too thick for my companion. Lots of pieces stuck together, which is never a good sign for pasta. Unfortunate, as the chicken sausage it came with was killer.  The service was fast, attentive, and friendly. The wine was decent, but I expected better. If you happen to navigate to the bathroom, you can't miss their wine cellar.",

Teaming up with two-time Michelin star Chef Missy Robbins, this intimate wine bar is inspired by a European style outdoor market vibe where people gather together for a casual glass of wine and some light bites.  At Corkbuzz, women really pave the way both behind the scenes and at the front end. Aside from Laura and Missy leading the charge â the team that helped put this together from design (Stephanie Goto) to construction, were women. A HUGE shoutout to our wonderful hostess Rachael Wilson, the Communications Director, who guided us through our afternoon of indulgence.  Corkbuzz Wine Bar aims to provide that ultimate space where all kinds of people with an interest in wine (from novice to expert) can come together to share this passion whilst sampling a glass or a bottle or two! The wine menu offers about 150 bottles of some of Maniecâs favorites as well as signature picks from top sommeliers.",

We made a reservation since we were a party of 5 on a Friday night, but we didn't need one--not much for a lively atmosphere, but it was early evening as we were trying to eat dinner before a show at the Highline Ballroom. The food and service were excellent. The waitress knew all the wines, drinks and the menu very well. We even spilled and broke a wine glass and they were incredibly cool about it and just moved us down one table while someone cleaned up our disaster area! \r \r This restaurant is located deep within Chelsea Market, so if you're looking for natural sunlight or to people watch passersby this is not your place. If you want incredibly tasty small plates and excellent service then come here!\r \r We would have eaten dessert, but I had a hankering for some kind of artisan cupcakes or macaroons and we found The Doughnuttery within Chelsea Market. It was SO good.",

That is how we ended up at PN Wood Fired Pizza in Chelsea. This is not your classic pizza place: I guess they call themselves the âblack Sheepâ or Pecore Nere (PN) in Italian because they make pizza a bit differently. They put pride in saying that they do not break the rules, they make them. Considering how good the food was, I have no problem with that!",

Already popular amongst New Yorkers, this 23,000 sqft place is amazing: two stories if not counting the downstairs floor where the bathrooms are, where a bar, sandwich and pastry stations feed an hungry crowd with some delicious food still casual but tasty, and Italian inspired. Sandwiches are made with breads from Le Pain Quotidien with a mix of vegetarian and non-vegetarian choices like the caprese panino made with mozzarella di bufala, cherry tomatoes and arugula; the sfilatino con pistachio mortadella that is made on a crispy thin olive bread or the brioche con prosciutto crudo e parmigiano regiano that is a croissant shaped brioche stuffed with prosciutto and Parmesan cheese. All of these were fresh and succulent, not that pricey for the quality you get.",

The warm and welcoming host took the time to describe the menu toÂ me in such detail that my mouth watered.Â While waiting for my meal, I nibbled on the thin breadsticks and housemade bomba that Rob, my friendly bartenderÂ served me.Â  Rob explained that the bomba is a traditional southern Italian condiment made from pickled shallots, mushrooms, artichokes and Calabrian chilies.",

Lovely food and impeccable service. I wouldn't expect any less from a \"Danny Meyers\" restaurant. I ordered the Prosciutto for my appetizers and the duck for my mains. I was told to order the pizza, but somehow got fixated on the duck. The Prosciutto was good, but the Duck was a whole different story. The minute the first piece went into my mouth, I felt I had attained Nirvana. Oh. My. God. It was cooked to perfection and had this tantalisingly crispy skin which was coated in salt. Ufff. Boy, if I had once dish that I could eat for a long time, it would be that duck.  This was one for the books and I will surely remember this meal for a long time.

This may perhaps be the only one. Aside from the size, the space feels like you entered an Italian kitchen. The aroma is exquisite and there is tons of pans hanging from the ceilings. Being half restaurant and half market, you can purchase freshly made pasta to-go as well.  Upon being seated, we were given bread served in a small brown paper bag. I ordered the eggplant ravioli. It was succulent and the filling (eggplant paste?) was generous on each piece. The cheese was fantastic and the tomatoes were the perfect combination for it. Our other dish was the orecchiette pasta. It was flavorful, but a bit too thick for my companion. Lots of pieces stuck together, which is never a good sign for pasta. Unfortunate, as the chicken sausage it came with was killer.  The service was fast, attentive, and friendly. The wine was decent, but I expected better. If you happen to navigate to the bathroom, you can't miss their wine cellar.","id":32167993,"rating_color":"5BA829","review_time_friendly":"oct 24, 2017","rating_text":"Great!","timestamp":1508857829,"likes":0,"user":{"name":"SC","zomato_handle":"latino","foodie_level":"Super Foodie","foodie_level_num":10,"foodie_color":"f58552","profile_url":"https:\/\/www.zomato.com\/es\/latino?utm_source=api_basic_user&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=v2.1","profile_image":"https:\/\/b.zmtcdn.com\/data\/user_profile_pictures\/eb9\/7d75e76876c578063b4eac346049aeb9.jpg?fit=around%7C100%3A100&crop=100%3A100%3B%2A%2C%2A","profile_deeplink":"zomato:\/\/u\/36968293"},"comments_count":0}},{"review":{"rating":5,"review_text":"This is one of the best pasta places I have ever been to.

wines and outstanding eats at Corkbuzz Wine Bar Chelsea Market.  Teaming up with two-time Michelin star Chef Missy Robbins, this intimate wine bar is inspired by a European style outdoor market vibe where people gather together for a casual glass of wine and some light bites.  At Corkbuzz, women really pave the way both behind the scenes and at the front end. Aside from Laura and Missy leading the charge \u2013 the team that helped put this together from design (Stephanie Goto) to construction, were women. A HUGE shoutout to our wonderful hostess Rachael Wilson, the Communications Director, who guided us through our afternoon of indulgence.  Corkbuzz Wine Bar aims to provide that ultimate space where all kinds of people with an interest in wine (from novice to expert) can come together to share this passion whilst sampling a glass or a bottle or two! The wine menu offers about 150 bottles of some of Maniec\u2019s favorites as well as signature picks from top sommeliers.","id":28190437,"rating_color":"9ACD32","review_time_friendly":"sep 12, 2016","rating_text":"Good Enough","timestamp":1473634942,"likes":1,"user":{"name":"The Restaurant Fairy","zomato_handle":"restaurantfairy","foodie_level":"Connoisseur","foodie_level_num":13,"foodie_color":"e95151","profile_url":"https:\/\/www.zomato.com\/es\/restaurantfairy?utm_source=api_basic_user&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=v2.1","profile_image":"https:\/\/b.zmtcdn.com\/data\/user_profile_pictures\/01c\/5faf422c4e3f7f66e8674edf7eeb001c.jpg?fit=around%7C100%3A100&crop=100%3A100%3B%2A%2C%2A","profile_deeplink":"zomato:\/\/u\/21266455"},"comments_count":0}},{"review":{"rating":4.5,"review_text":"Fantastic space to relax over a vino to escape the hectic Chelsea market.

We made a reservation since we were a party of 5 on a Friday night, but we didn't need one--not much for a lively atmosphere, but it was early evening as we were trying to eat dinner before a show at the Highline Ballroom. The food and service were excellent. The waitress knew all the wines, drinks and the menu very well. We even spilled and broke a wine glass and they were incredibly cool about it and just moved us down one table while someone cleaned up our disaster area! \r \r This restaurant is located deep within Chelsea Market, so if you're looking for natural sunlight or to people watch passersby this is not your place. If you want incredibly tasty small plates and excellent service then come here!\r \r We would have eaten dessert, but I had a hankering for some kind of artisan cupcakes or macaroons and we found The Doughnuttery within Chelsea Market.

Sandwiches are made with breads from Le Pain Quotidien with a mix of vegetarian and non-vegetarian choices like the caprese panino made with mozzarella di bufala, cherry tomatoes and arugula; the sfilatino con pistachio mortadella that is made on a crispy thin olive bread or the brioche con prosciutto crudo e parmigiano regiano that is a croissant shaped brioche stuffed with prosciutto and Parmesan cheese.
